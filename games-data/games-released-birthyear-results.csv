You start in your base and create your own hero choosing different faces, shirts, pants, etc. Training missions will improve your skills on a firing range, bungee jumping, scuba diving, taking photographs, and street luge. Then other areas will open up and Action Man will journey through varied locales such as urban cities, tropical forests, and the frozen arctic. You'll swim, jump, and climb your way through levels battling criminals and avoiding dangers of all sorts.

To ensure victory, the player must gather resources in order to pay for new units, buildings and more advanced technologies. Resources must also be preserved, as no new resources become available as the game progresses, meaning if you cut a tree down, the tree will not grow back. Twelve civilizations are available, each with individual sets of attributes, including a varying number of available technologies and units. Each civilization has technologies unique to them, so that no civilization possesses all the technologies possible within the game. A major component of the game is the advancement through four ages. These are the Stone Age (Mesolithic/Paleolithic), Tool Age (Neolithic/Chalcolithic), Bronze Age and Iron Age. Advancement between ages is researched at the Town Center and each advancement brings the player new technologies, weapons, and units.",1999-09-24 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,83.3612,8

145661,64157,Alex Builds His Farm,"Alex is a lively and cheerful little boy who loves nature and animals. He often goes running along the forest paths with his dog Oscar. All the animals in the forest know him. Alex is also a great dreamer. Sometimes he sits under a tree and turns the pages of his favourite book: The Big Farming Book.

He sits there enjoying the sun, cooled by a gentle breeze. On such occasions Alex sometimes falls asleep and dreams of a magnificent farm with cows, funny little hens and affectionate horses. One day, Alex and Oscar went running in a field at the edge of the forest. In the middle of the field stood a scarecrow to keep the crows away. When Oscar and Alex passed close to the scarecrow they heard a strange noise. Alex was surprised and looked all around, but couldn't see anything strange or unusual. Just as Alex and Oscar were about to continue their race, Alex heard the noise again. It was as if someone was calling him:
- Psst! Pssst! Alex, it's me!
It was the scarecrow! Alex couldn't believe his eyes.
- But...! You can speak! said Alex in surprise.
-Yes, of course I can speak, said the scarecrow. But I only speak to children who like animals and nature. Like you, Alex!
The scarecrow had a big smile. He looked nice and funny at the same time. He spoke again:
-You know what Alex? I often see you sleeping under a tree in the forest. Did you know that when you dream in the middle of the forest, your dreams can come true?
- Er... No, I didn't know that, said Alex.
-Well, because you're a good little boy and you love nature so much, I'm going to tell you a secret: when you wake up, all you have to do is concentrate very intensely on your dream and do everything you canto make it come true!
- That's easy! said Alex.
- Yes! But above all, you mustn't forget to have fun! Other
wise, it's no longer a dream!
- Thanks, Mr Scarecrow! That's a great secret!
- Bye, bye!
As soon as Alex had finished talking with the scarecrow, he and Miro ran faster than ever in the direction of a large oak tree, the most majestic tree in the forest. Alex was keen to see if the scarecrow had been telling the truth. He sat down under the tree and shut his eyes. He listened to the birds singing and the sound of the wind in the trees, but Alex couldn't manage to fall asleep. He was far too excited by the scarecrow's secret! So he picked up his favourite book, the Good Farmer's Handbook and started to look at the pictures one after the other. Little by little, his eyelids shut and he fell asleep. And dreamt... He dreamt of his family, and a magnificent farm.",1999-12-31 00:00:00.000,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

As an Alien the player must defend the Alien hive from human marines, then stow away on an evacuating spacecraft and reach the marines' ship, the Ferarco. When the Ferarco's self-destruct system is activated, the player must reach the escape shuttle, which takes them to Gateway Station. Here the player explores the station and battles more marines, reaching a ship departing for Earth. Before boarding the ship the player battles two Predators, after which the Alien enters the Earth-bound shuttle.

When playing as the Colonial Marine, the player begins at a research station on LV-426 built to study the derelict spacecraft where the Nostromo crew first encountered the Alien eggs in the film Alien (1979). Aliens attack and the player must fight their way through the research facility, the derelict ship, and an adjoining colony. Next the player explores the atmosphere processing station and shuts down its cooling valves in order to cause an explosion which will wipe out the Aliens. The player character escapes in a drop ship and travels to Odobenus Station in orbit above the planetoid, where they battle more Aliens, Predators, facehuggers, and cybernetically-enhanced Aliens until reaching the spaceship Tyrargo. Aboard the ship the player battles more enemies including an Alien/Predator hybrid and ""praetorian"" Aliens. The player then battles an Alien queen, defeating it by expelling it through the airlock.

The Predator character's storyline visits three different planets, beginning with the player hunting marines in order to recover a captured Predator ship and its occupant from a human military base. Aliens are accidentally released in the base and the player discovers that the humans have created an Alien/Predator hybrid by implanting the captured Predator with an Alien embryo. The player defeats the hybrid, triggers the facility's self-destruct mechanism, and escapes in the Predator ship. The player next visits Fiorina ""Fury"" 161, the prison planet that is the setting of Alien 3 (1992), where more Aliens and marines are battled. Finally the player visits a marine-controlled Alien habitat, battling cybernetically-enhanced Aliens, ""praetorian"" Aliens, and finally the Alien Queen.",1999-04-30 00:00:00.000,11,NULL,NULL,NULL,77.9888,40

During a time long past, a traveler settled among the people of Shrikar. The traveler’s knowledge, skills
and power led them to believe that he was the chosen Emissary of the god Ceth. As time passed, the
traveler taught the people of Shrikar how to Weave, or shape the natural energy flows of their planet. The
Emissary also taught the basic skills of architecture and of controlling creatures of the land, improving the
way life for the people of Shrikar. An age of prosperity and enlightenment began and the people lived
better than ever before.

As the people of Shrikar continued to advance in their skill and knowledge of Weaving, the Emissary left to
continue his journey once more. To honor him and his teachings, the people created the Arcomage Guild; a
school dedicated to the knowledge that the Emissary brought to Shrikar. Graduation from this Guild
bestowed the title of Arcomage upon the worthy student, one who understood and excelled in the ways of
Weaving, of Control and of Building. The Golden Age of Shrikar had reached its pinnacle.

One hundred years after the departure of the Emissary, the first Arcomage War struck the people of
Shrikar. The Arcomage Crowhain assaulted the citadel of the Arcomage Ralbeard. The surrounding
countryside was laid to waste. Years after the war started, Ralbeard completely destroyed the citadel of his
enemy. The scars upon the world of Shrikar were slow to heal. Over the next five hundred years the people
of Shrikar would experience the wars of Arcomages hundreds of times, as mages strove to increase their
power and reputations.

You have been challenged, Arcomage! The enemy is at the gates and it is now time to put your skills and
tactics to the test. Gather your resources, summon your armies and join the battle!",1999-12-31 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Although each chapter is autonomous the final reward of each one is another piece of ""the road to Shamballa"".

Yucatán The character in the Yucatán chapter is Tepec, a loyal follower of a local city's king. Tepec's kingdom is in trouble because its protector-god, Quetzalcoatl (the Feathered Serpent), has fallen asleep and as a result great misfortunes happen to the kingdom; the corn crop is dying and a rival king makes a campaign to conquer Tepec's kingdom. So Tepec is assigned with the mission to go to the land of the dead, Xibalba, and awaken Quetzalcoatl to receive chulel, the divine blood which has life giving powers.

Ireland Ten is transformed into Felim, a monk living in an Irish monastery in the early centuries of Christianity. He discovers a living remain of an ancient Irish king and then begins interacting with a set of characters from an old myth which is written in a book in the monastery library. His final goal is to help the characters get to the end of the story.

China In this chapter Ten is in the body of a travelling Chinese civil servant who is stuck in a monastery because a ghost-shadow is blocking the entrance. As water supplies are running short, he decides to use the help of the Master of Directions to travel to a Chinese version of the land of the dead to consult an immortal excorcism master.

Shamballa Shamballa is a fantasy place, which acts as a final screen of protection between the home base and the Dark's prison. Queen Rhea, a character from the prequel of the series is waiting there to link the story between the two games and guide Ten to the final level of the game, which is no other than the sunk Atlantis.",1999-12-31 00:00:00.000,3,NULL,70.0000,2,40.0000,2

The games vary in their gameplay, but the usual assortment of speed and reflex tests are the common thread. You'll need to clear four mini-games each to go hunting and fishing.

During the course of the game, Cornell comes upon a grand estate owned by the Oldrey family: J.A. Oldrey, the master of the Villa, Mary, his wife, and Henry, their son. Gilles de Rais and Actrise have turned Oldrey Senior into a vampire. At Mary's request, Cornell guides Henry to safety. Later in life, Henry returns to Castlevania to save kidnapped children.
Throughout the game, Cornell encounters his rival and fellow man-beast, Ortega. Ortega has allied himself with Dracula to finally beat Cornell in combat, turning into a chimera like creature. They eventually battle near the end of the game, just before Cornell defeats Dracula and saves his sister. He only accomplishes the latter by sacrificing his man-wolf powers. Unbeknownst to the hero, acquiring this power was the true aim of the dark forces, as it was the perfect sacrifice (not Ada, as Cornell had assumed) to resurrect Dracula at his full power.",1999-12-08 00:00:00.000,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,59.9825,12

52414,340,Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun,"While the game is set only twenty years after its predecessor, the world of Tiberian Sun is much different. The lethal Tiberium continues to infect the world at an ever-increasing rate which has made most of the Earth uninhabitable for human beings. To survive, GDI has moved to the arctic regions of the world while NOD has set up camp underground.

The game’s story is driven by the difference in goals between GDI and NOD. As GDI strives to maintain world peace and discover the root cause of Tiberium, NOD is hell-bent on achieving world domination. The story is complicated by the apparent loss of Kane, NOD’s leader, at the end of the first Tiberian War which has thrown the Brotherhood into leaderless disarray, but do not count them out just yet as NOD has created through genetic mutation via Tiberium a set of ultra-powerful units that more than compensate for the clan’s lack of organization.",1999-08-20 00:00:00.000,46,NULL,NULL,NULL,82.6530,116

After being jolted awake by a tone over the airplane's PA system and a friendly conversation with a fellow passenger named David, a group of terrorists, who seem to be guided by some kind of mysterious cultist chanting to himself, suddenly and violently takes control of the plane. David, who turns out to be a special agent within the FBI, attempts to stop the terrorists, but he is thwarted when a meteorite strikes the plane, sending it crashing into the Canadian wilderness. After a series of bad dreams, Laura awakens in a small cabin being cared for by Kimberly Fox, a poet and songwriter who also survived the crash. She explains that ten days have passed since the accident, although Kimberly had only found her some distance from the crash site two days prior, leaving a strange eight-day gap where she was mysteriously taken care of. The moment of peace is broken when another survivor, one of the hijackers, staggers into the cabin before suddenly transforming into a hideous plant-like monster. Here, Laura and Kimberly meet Parker Jackson, a CETI researcher and fellow crash survivor who drives out the monster, only to be driven out himself by a distrusting Kimberly.

Laura then sets out into the wilderness in order to investigate the possibility of contacting the outside world and seeking out other survivors only to discover that more strange, hideous creatures are lurking in the area, as something is causing the crash survivors to mutate into the very same monsters she must avoid and battle while travelling through the region. She is driven deeper into the mystery when she must venture into an abandoned mining facility in order to locate Jannie, a lost little girl Kimberly had found along with Laura and one of the plane's former passengers.",1999-12-23 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

80033,675,Driver,"NYPD officer and former racing driver John Tanner is sent undercover by his boss Lieutenant McKenzie to discover the intentions of a crime syndicate led by Castaldi. McKenzie instructs Tanner to go to Miami and meet a pimp named Rufus. After arriving in Miami, Tanner uses his driving skills to prove himself to some gangsters in a parking garage, allowing him to become their getaway driver.

Tanner carries out jobs for various gangsters before meeting Rufus, who tasks Tanner with rescuing Jean-Paul, one of Rufus's associates. Rufus is later shot by his girlfriend Jesse. Needing more information for his investigation, Tanner apprehends Jesse and takes her to the police station, where she reveals that Jean-Paul is now in San Francisco.

Tanner goes to San Francisco, where he meets Castaldi, Jean-Paul's boss, and begins working directly for him. He also meets Rusty Slater, his former racing rival, who also works for Castaldi. Tanner later learns that Castaldi is working with a man named Don Hancock, who is running for president. He later suspects that Slater has been spying on him and wrecks Slater's car during a road chase, resulting in Slater being arrested.

The Castaldi family move to Los Angeles, where Castaldi plans to assassinate FBI agent Bill Maddox as part of Castaldi's plan to carry out a more high-profile assassination in New York. Tanner tells Leck, a police associate, to ensure Maddox turns up, otherwise Tanner's cover may be affected. The assassination on Maddox is successful, but the police ambush the gangsters, forcing Tanner to take them to safety. Tanner convinces the suspicious gangsters that Slater likely told the police about the planned assassination while under interrogation. Leck later tells Tanner that McKenzie recently met Marcus Vaughn, a corrupt FBI agent who is working with Castaldi and Hancock.

The Castaldi family then move to New York, the location of the planned high-profile assassination. Tanner is told by his police associates that McKenzie wants him to pull out of the undercover operation, as he is worried that Tanner's cover will not hold up much longer, and Leck tells Tanner that Hancock has bribed several members of the FBI. Tanner remains undercover and continues working for Castaldi, intent on discovering what he is planning.

Tanner eventually learns that Castaldi plans to assassinate the President of the United States, and Tanner is tasked with driving the President's car. However, he ignores all instructions and takes the President to safety. McKenzie then arrives and tells Tanner that Castaldi and all of his associates, including Hancock and Vaughn, have been arrested. He then tells Tanner to take his badge back, but Tanner refuses, suspecting that the police and FBI are involved in the job, corrupted by bribes due to Vaughn's involvement. Tanner leaves, ignoring McKenzie completely.",1999-06-25 00:00:00.000,52,NULL,95.0000,2,76.5345,147

He was taken to a laboratory along with the machine to be further studied. 
 
Upon analyzing the machine, they learned that it was over 5000 years old. They also could not find any form of power source. In time, the machine became known as ""Elemental Gimmick Gear"", or EGG for short. After extensive scientific analysis over a number of years, copies of the EGG were produced and used as vehicles. 
 
100 years later, the ruin suddenly became active, extending a multitude of tentacles into the ground. They spread all across the land, destroying anything in their way. With the tentacles came a thick layer of fog that surrounded the ruins, and people gave them the name Fogna.

181341,1502,Front Mission 3,"There are two plots of Front Mission 3, and both revolve around Japanese wanzer test pilots Kazuki Takemura and Ryogo Kusama. Through a decision made early in the game, the player can play either the DHZ scenario or the USN scenario. The DHZ scenario stars Japanese scientist Aliciana ""Alisa"" Takemura, while the USN scenario revolves around scientist Emir ""Emma"" Klamsky.

Although both scenarios have different characters and story scenarios, they both share a number of events and locations in the game. Due to its storytelling approach, it is not known which of the two scenarios is canonically related to Front Mission 5: Scars of the War. On October 31, Kazuki begins testing a new prototype wanzer at a Kirishima Heavy Industries test site near Okinawa. Upon completing the test, he is informed that some construction wanzers need to be taken to the JDF base in Yokosuka. Ryogo asks Kazuki if he can join him in delivering the wanzers. If the player chooses to go with him, they will play the USN scenario. If the player does not go with him, they will play the DHZ scenario.

In either case, Kazuki and Ryogo are eventually tasked to deliver the Kirishima prototypes to the Yokosuka base. As they ready the wanzers for delivery, an explosion leads Kazuki to attempt going inside the base itself. The two test pilots are eventually forced to leave the base. Realizing that his sister Alisa was recently transferred to the base, Kazuki and Ryogo eventually find themselves back inside the complex.",1999-09-02 00:00:00.000,8,NULL,NULL,NULL,80.7523,22

Afterward, Niko Tatopoulos called Major Anthony Hicks to tell him to stop attacking Godzilla, who had just saved the city, but Hicks revealed that no-one had orders to attack Godzilla. He was chased into the water by a helicopter, and went ashore on an island. On the island, Godzilla was attacked by more military vehicles and a population of Giant Mutant Bees, and eventually fought their Queen. After defeating the Mutant Bees, H.E.A.T. noticed that military assets were still attacking Godzilla, and they decided to continue facing them to get to their source. As Godzilla continued, he was met with more military and Cyber Flies before facing an enormous tank. After that, H.E.A.T. began to investigate tar on a beach that they believed to be linked to the disappearance of several swimmers. They were then attacked by a Mutant Giant Squid, which Godzilla defeated before more attacked, along with the military. Eventually they came upon some squids that were not charred from Godzilla's Fire Balls, but encased in the digestive tar they had found earlier. Before they could ponder for too long as to what was really creating the tar, the Crustaceous Rex surfaced and attacked Godzilla. While it was capable of using its tar to immobilize Godzilla, he was able to defeat it. After noticing that Godzilla was acting very hyperactive, H.E.A.T. was contacted by Cameron Winter, who accused them of trespassing before admitting that he was behind the odd military attacks on Godzilla in order to test his Solstice Technologies weapons, and that he was using a machine to control Godzilla. N.I.G.E.L. was able to dismantle it, and Godzilla advanced on the island and defeated updated versions of the Solstice Helicopter and Solstice Tank. Godzilla then reached the Solstice Industries facility on the island and destroyed it.

However, Shephard is prevented from reaching the extraction point by the enigmatic G-Man, forcing the evacuation craft to leave without him.

Other Marines who have also been left behind team up with Shephard and attempt to reach another extraction point near Black Mesa's Lambda Complex, but en route they come under attack from black operations units seeking to thoroughly contain the situation and eliminate all survivors. Shephard makes it to the Lambda Complex alive, and briefly sees Gordon Freeman as the latter teleports to Xen in the final stages of Half-Life. To escape the teleportation chamber, Shephard is forced to enter a separate portal, briefly taking him to Xen before depositing him in an entirely different area of the facility. The facility is now heavily damaged, and it soon becomes clear that a new alien race, Race X, has exploited the situation to mount a localized invasion, attacking both human and Xen forces in Black Mesa indiscriminately. Fighting between the black operations units and Race X quickly intensifies.

Shephard soon encounters more stranded Marine units in the wreckage of the base, and tries to break through the black operations units to reach an escape point past the facility's storage unit, but meets heavy resistance from both Race X and the black operations units. A surviving Black Mesa security guard reveals to Shephard that the black operators intend to detonate a tactical nuclear weapon in the base, thereby totally sealing it off and killing everything in it. After successfully neutralizing the guarding black operations unit, Shephard disarms the device and proceeds to the nearby storage areas, intent on escape. However, the G-Man rearms the device as Shephard departs. The storage unit has become a thick battleground between Race X and the black operation units, and although Shephard manages to evade them, he is informed by another security guard that something very large is coming through an alien portal blocking the exit path.

At the portal, Shephard discovers a gene worm, a massive creature facilitating the Race X invasion. Shephard is able to kill the creature, but just afterwards he is teleported onto an Osprey by the G-Man. As the G-Man congratulates Shephard on his accomplishments, the nuclear device detonates in the background, destroying Black Mesa. The game closes with the G-Man detaining Shephard someplace where he can tell no one of what he has seen and cannot be harmed, pending further evaluation.",1999-11-10 00:00:00.000,99,NULL,70.0000,1,80.9408,259

The boy befriended his grandfather's puppy and met a little girl his own age with whom he became close friends. When the summer was over the boy had to go back home, but he promised the little girl that he would return someday.

Ten years later, years after his grandfather's death, the boy – now a grown man – returns to the town to take over the farm. Upon meeting the main character, the mayor and other villagers decide that he would be allowed to stay as the rightful owner if he restored the farm to its original state within three years.

187127,364,Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Restoration of Erathia,"The game's story unfolds primarily through a series of seven playable campaigns, all set upon the continent of Antagarich. During the campaigns, the story is told from alternating points of view, giving players the opportunity to play as each of the town alignments.

Following the disappearance of King Roland Ironfist of Enroth prior to Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven, his wife, Queen Catherine, is left to rule the realm. In the meantime, her father, King Gryphonheart of Erathia, is assassinated. Without their beloved King, the kingdom of Erathia falls to the dark forces of Nighon and Eeofol. Queen Catherine returns home to Antagarich seeking to rally the people of her homeland and lead them against the evil that has ravaged their nation.

Erathia's capital of Steadwick is sacked by the dungeon lords of Nighon and the Kreegans of Eeofol. Meanwhile, the nations of Tatalia and Krewlod skirmish at the western border, seizing the chance to expand their territory. Catherine's first task is to establish a foothold in the conquered kingdom by enlisting the aid of allies. The wizards of Bracada and the elves of AvLee answer her call, and together they push towards Steadwick and eventually retake it, quickly quelling the border war in the west. Soon after, Lucifer Kreegan, a commander in the Eeofol armies, sends an envoy to Erathia claiming that Roland Ironfist is captive within their territories. AvLee invades Eeofol, but fails to rescue Roland, who is transported to their northern holdings. Afterwards, Catherine invades Nighon, pushing the dungeon armies back to their island home.

In the meantime, the necromancers of Deyja, having been responsible for the assassination of King Gryphonheart, plot to revive his corpse as a lich. They plan to use his wisdom in leading their own armies of the undead. However, King Gryphonheart's will proves too much for the necromancers even in his corrupted state, and he becomes a rogue lich. Having little other recourse, Queen Catherine is forced to ally herself with the necromancers and together they set out to destroy the lich of King Gryphonheart before he becomes too powerful.

A final bonus campaign, accessible only after the main campaigns are complete, tells the story of separatists living in the Contested Lands, a war-torn border between Erathia and AvLee. Tired of the skirmishes that bring unrest to their homelands, they join together to fight for independence from the two large kingdoms. It is later implied that this rising was orchestrated by Archibald Ironfist, the antagonist of Heroes of Might and Magic II.",1999-02-28 00:00:00.000,163,NULL,91.0000,1,89.1805,452

33124,43559,Hype - The Time Quest,"The story begins during King Taskan IV's reign, following the end of a civil war. Hype, the champion of the kingdom, is being rewarded for his loyalty and valor by being presented with the powerful Sword of Peace. However, during the ceremony a mysterious and powerful black knight riding a dragon unexpectedly appears. The knight steps to the King and demands the throne. At that moment, Hype steps before the knight and attempts to confront him, but the black knight is too strong and with the use of powerful magic, transforms Hype into a statue of stone and casts him deep into the past. Two hundred years earlier, Hype's statue appears in the courtyard of an apprentice magician: Gogoud. 
 
After many failed attempts to revive Hype, the young magician, Gogoud, manages to restore Hype to life. As Hype recovers his memory he quickly explains his ordeal with the black knight - known as Barnak - and how he must return to his own time in order to protect his king, take revenge on Barnak and marry his betrothed, Vibe. Sorrowfully, Gogoud explains that he as a magician is not very experienced and is as currently only an apprentice. Still, the young man agrees to help Hype and guide him on his quest through time. Gogoud comes to learn that in order for Hype to return to the future, he must collect a number of jewels. Both are dismayed to learn that each Jewel only allows Hype to advance one leap through time, meaning that he will have to collect and charge jewels hidden in the reigns of Taskan I, II and III before returning to the era of Taskan IV. Throughout his journey, Hype meets a number of faithful friends, including: Zatila the dragon, Karon, leader of the brigands, her daughter Nohlin and many others. On the other hand, Hype also encounters a great number of foes including King Taskan I and his followers; Rajoth the magician - founder of the Laboratories; Enost - King Taskan III's wizard, who defects to the Barnak's side; numerous different soldiers, including Barnak's armies of Black Guards and other servants; Barnak's black dragon Vhoid and finally the evil Barnak himself. Hype also confronts many non-human enemies including wolves, spectres, bats and a three-headed dragon. Hype's adventures take place in the same kingdom throughout different periods of its history. Rivalries and wars erupt between the fortress, the monastery, the brigands and the magicians in the laboratories. Upon returning to his own time, Hype is reunited with Vibe and together they form an army in order to begin an uprising against Barnak, who has taken control of the kingdom. His large army enforce his diabolical regime, forcing the kingdom's people to worship their master as a God, as well as a King. The entire kingdom is guarded by Barnak's evil minions, with the main areas of the Town of Torras, the Forest, Gogoud's Manor, the Brigand Village and the Fortress being closely watched, while 'un-necessary' areas such as the Monastery, Laboratories, and the Field of Courage are closed off at Barnak's command. Most disturbing however, it is due to Barnak's conquest the land has become desolate and a fiery sky above foreshadows Barnak's triumph - causing great sadness over the kingdom's people. The land however, is finally restored to its former beauty when the Black Knight is defeated - his dark magic that plagued the kingdom broken. The spirit of Gougoud tells tales of a new world as the story ends with peace returning to the land.",1999-11-20 00:00:00.000,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

He must not only deal with those issues but also seek out answers to help close new rifts that have appeared throughout the Lands.

182629,19190,MechWarrior 3,"The story opens with a short briefing of the Inner Sphere's Operation: Bulldog, a daring plan to eliminate the most hostile and vicious clan in the Inner Sphere: Clan Smoke Jaguar, led by Anastasius Focht and Victor Steiner-Davion. Operation Bulldog and Task Force Serpent have already completed their objectives, but there is one last operation left—the one with which the player is tasked—the disruption of a ranking Smoke Jaguar officer's attempt to rally and restore the Clan forces. This mission (codename: Damocles) is to destroy key Smoke Jaguar installations on the planet Tranquil, including a mech factory, a starport, a geothermal power plant, and the Smoke Jaguar control structure. The mission is a commando operation with limited forces, and does not include elimination of the enemy as an objective. 
 
Two dropships are deployed to release the BattleMech force to destroy these installations. However, while in orbit above Tranquil, a dropship is attacked by naval laser fire. The Blackhammer is shot down and the remaining dropship, the Eclipse, retreats to safety. The player was already deployed from the dropship, which had been slightly off target before it was destroyed. The Mobile Field Bases (MFB), which were deployed at the same time as the player, land on target. The player's first mission is to rendezvous with the MFBs and secure the area from hostile forces. 
 
At least seven Mechs are deployed. Two are destroyed by the enemy near the beginning of the game and one toward the end. The novelization mentions one more casualty lost due to a parachute malfunction. The remaining four survivors gradually link up over the course of the game. Twelve more Mechs remain aboard the Eclipse, but they cannot be deployed directly, and an attempt to fight through from a safe landing area fails after heavy casualties. Despite this setback, the player must continue with his objectives, and eventually secure a landing zone so the dropship can return to evacuate them.",1999-12-31 00:00:00.000,2,1,NULL,NULL,88.1713,8
181229,1307,Medal of Honor,"BEFORE THE CIA, THERE WAS THE OSS

The Office of Strategic Services was officially created in June 1942, under the guidance of General 'Wild Bill' Donovan. If ever the romantic notions of being a spy actually excited, it was probably with the OSS. Young men and women, often recruited right out of college, entered into the cloak and dagger world of wartime intelligence. It was an exciting and dangerous time, and as the war grew so did the mission of the OSS. Sabotage, search & rescue and subversion all became part of the organisation's daily operation.

That's when a young Lieutenant in the Air Transport Corps entered the picture and changed the OSS forever. On June 5, 1944 - the night before the D-Day invasion - the largest aerial drop of troops in history up to that point was launched by the Allied command. It was an unmitigated disaster. Most of the planes missed thier targets, were shot down or crashed due to bad weather. One pilot, however, got the regiment he was carrying to its correct drop zone before his C-47 transport was forced down by enemy fire. He was Jimmy Patterson, an unassuming twenty-four year old from Carthage, MO.

Patterson heroically protected his injured crew from a roving German patrol, single-handedly taking out a half dozen of the Wehrmacht before help arrived. For his actions, he was nominated for the Congressional Medal of Honor - the nation's highest military award. Just days before being sent back to the States for a War Bonds tour, however, Patterson disappeared from his infirmary bed. Medal of Honor tells the story of what happened next.",1999-10-31 00:00:00.000,35,NULL,75.0000,1,77.4880,113

You are Sergeant Ash, an anti terrorist specialist. 
 
During training exercises in Africa you are suddenly recalled and flown to HQ for a top-secret briefing: 
 
We are sorry to bring you in at such short notice Sergeant. Two days ago rebel forces took the Meteor complex by storm, they are our holding many of our troops captive. The situation has been in deadlock for some days now, we can't even get close without threats of mass destruction. We are considering these as very real threats even though we are not sure whether the rebels have the encrypted firing codes. 
 
We need you to move in now, just be careful because there sill is plenty of fighting breaking out with the rebel forces, if they find out that we have sent someone inside the complex the situation could grow far more serious. 
 
It is not your job to get involved with the fighting, your job is to simply carry out a number of key objectives that will feed you after you are inside. We need you to work on saving the Meteor complex while our troops attempt to hold firm. 
 
Don't let us down Sergeant, you are best we have got.

It is said that one monster is trapped inside each one. One day a group of workers excavating the ancient ruins happened to dig up one of these mythical disc stones. The worker who first discovered a disc stone took the disc to the Monsters' Temple. There the priests, using the ancient methods, unlocked the monster inside the disc stone. In a place where ranchers and monsters coexisted peacefully, the battle of the monsters began.

190785,1982,Omikron: The Nomad Soul,"“Well, on one level, it’s your basic good ’n’ evil story. On another, it explores themes of camouflaged totalitarianism and desperate revolution. The game strives to be relevant in the real world by being part of the game. Does that stand to reason? By tying the concept of the game of Omikron strongly to reality and defining the player’s character in terms of their actual life, we clearly connected the parallel universe to our own. In effect, the player’s own life becomes our setting. Quantic believes it may be the world’s first Buddhist game--Buddhist with guns, I call it.”
– Eidos Senior Designer Philip Campbell

Soon after the player begins the investigation in Anekbah sector, he uncovers information that suggests the serial killer he is looking for is, in fact, not human but actually a demon. When members of an apparent underground, anti-government movement contact the player and confirm his suspicions, the investigation deepens and uncovers information that one of Omikron's chief police commanders (Commandant Gandahar) is, in fact, a demon pretending to be human and luring human souls into Omikron from other dimensions by way of the video game that the player is actually interacting with. Despite many attempts on his life by other demons working behind the scenes, the player then uses supernatural weaponry of ancient origin to destroy Gandhar. After this brief victory, the player is then invited to join the mysterious anti-government movement that call themselves ""The Awakened"", referring to the fact they have ""awakened"" from the lies and drugs of the government. The Awakened work in tandem with an ancient religious order who are led by ""Boz"", a mystical being that exists in purely electronic form on the computer networks of Omikron. The Awakened refer to the player as ""The Nomad Soul"" since he has the ability to change bodies at will. The Nomad Soul also learns that what is going on in Omikron is merely an extension of a thousands-of-years-old battle between mankind and demons led by the powerful Astaroth. Astaroth, who was banished to the depths of Omikron long ago, is slowly regenerating power while using demons to both collect souls and impersonate high members of the government so that he can eventually take complete control and move across the planet and, indeed, the universe. Only by harnessing ancient, magical technology and re-discovering several hidden tombs and catacombs underneath Omikron's surface, can the Nomad Soul hope to discover how to destroy Astaroth, return to his own dimension, and prevent his soul from being captured by demons.",1999-10-31 00:00:00.000,12,NULL,70.0000,1,81.0942,21

There are dozens of venues, unique individual opponents and even different-shaped and unique tables are also available to unlock.

In one player mode, called ""Hustle Mode"", the character must hustle your way through smoke filled bars, casinos, pool halls and nightclubs and aim to black ball up to 18 challengers of ever-increasing skill across a range of challenging tables. There is an interactive tutorial if the player wishes, and the player can learn hundreds of trick shots from the tutorial. Each individual NPC opponent has its own unique appearance, voice, mannerisms, playing style and difficulty, and winning tournaments unlocks new NPCs to play against and venues to play in. The last opponent is the Devil himself, who you will play in Hell on his very own pool table and play for your very soul.

There are also the traditional two-player modes, as well as three-player, four-player, and so on. Any number of players can join in, and tournaments for up to 16 players are also available in which the NPC's can also be included.

An army of Robot Pirates, led by Admiral Razorbeard, invades this world and destroys the Heart of the World, the world core. This greatly weakens the resistance's power and disables Rayman's powers, leading to his capture.[9]

Globox, a friend of Rayman, is later also captured and put in the same cell as Rayman aboard the Pirates' prison ship. Globox gives Rayman a silver lum given to him by Ly the fairy, which restores his powers. Rayman escapes the prison ship, and is separated from Globox again. He learns that to stand a chance against the Pirates, he needs to find four ancient magic masks to awaken Polokus, the spirit of the world, hidden in secret and mysterious sanctuaries consisting of the four elements water/ice, earth/stone, fire, and air.[10] He travels through the Glade of Dreams via the Hall of Doors, a magical place linked to various locations in the world, controlled by the ancient Teensies.[10]

In the course of the game, Rayman frees Globox who had been captured again, and they continue together for a short while until Globox departs again to go find his family. Later, Rayman finds Globox's wife Uglette and learns that he has been imprisoned on the Prison Ship. Rayman also encounters his friend Clark, a strongman who has stomach problems due to eating rusty pirates; to continue through the level, Rayman has to cure Clark by means of an elixir.

Eventually, Rayman recovers the four masks and awakens Polokus, who makes quick work of the pirates on land. In the air however, he has no power, and Rayman is tasked to dispose of the Pirates' flying Prison Ship, where Admiral Razorbeard also has his headquarters. In a final battle Rayman fights Razorbeard, who is controlling a giant robot, the Grolgoth. Eventually Rayman destroys the robot and while Razorbeard escapes in a small escape pod, the Prison Ship explodes. Rayman is presumed dead and only one of his shoes is found, but during his funeral, he appears again, walking on a crutch.",1999-10-22 00:00:00.000,48,NULL,90.0000,1,80.6710,161

Machines have taken over. Corporate greed and rapid technological advancements have made humans pawns of their own creations. During the first fifteen years of the 21st century, Mega Corp began to dominate computer technology in both peacekeeping and war-fighting applications. As this giant churned out better and better technology for manufacturing and warfare, humans were relegated to service industries or to working as drones on PC terminals. Mega Corp became the largest employer in the United States. By 2010, every computer in America used Mega Corp software and was Internet-connected and monitored through the Mega Corp Network—anti-trust suits be damned. Each day, Mega Corp would issue government-endorsed messages through the Network that broadcast pro-machine propaganda. The country was becoming brainwashed. In 2018, the wonders of artificial intelligence turned ugly in the hands of a few disillusioned Mega Corp programmers. Frustrated at being a part of such an ethically challenged corporation, these hacks altered coding in various Mega Corp products—turning certain robot and tank machinery into self-directed, man-killing machines. Today, May 2019, in a war-torn, machine-ravaged world, only a few freethinkers remain. Only a few outsiders have escaped the spell of the Network.
